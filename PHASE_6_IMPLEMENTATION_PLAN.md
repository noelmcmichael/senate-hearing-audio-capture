# Phase 6: Speaker Identification Improvement - Implementation Plan

## 🎯 Objective
Improve speaker identification accuracy through human-in-the-loop corrections and automated voice recognition, running Phase 6A and 6B in parallel for maximum efficiency.

## 📊 Current State Analysis

### Transcription Output Format
```json
{
  "segments": [
    {
      "id": 0,
      "start": 57.16,
      "end": 59.96,
      "text": "Thank you.",
      "confidence": "low",
      "likely_speaker_change": true,
      "words": [...]
    }
  ],
  "speaker_analysis": {
    "identified_speakers": {},
    "unknown_segments": 150,
    "confidence_distribution": {...}
  }
}
```

### Key Issues to Address
- **Unknown speakers**: Many segments lack speaker identification
- **Low confidence**: Need human verification for accuracy
- **Speaker changes**: Detection exists but needs refinement
- **Limited reviewer capacity**: Must be extremely easy to use

## 🔄 Parallel Development Strategy

### **Phase 6A: Human Review Interface (Web-based)**
**Timeline**: 1-2 weeks | **Priority**: HIGH

#### Week 1: Core Review Interface
- **Transcript Viewer**: Audio playback with synchronized transcript
- **Speaker Assignment**: Click-to-assign speakers to segments
- **Bulk Operations**: "This is Senator Cruz throughout" functionality
- **Audio Controls**: Play/pause, seek, speed control

#### Week 2: Review Workflow
- **Save/Load Sessions**: Resume partial reviews
- **Export Corrections**: JSON format for learning integration
- **Quality Metrics**: Track review progress and accuracy

### **Phase 6B: Voice Collection System (Automated)**
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks | **Priority**: MEDIUM

#### Week 1-2: Sample Collection
- **Multi-source scraping**: C-SPAN, YouTube, Senate.gov
- **Priority senators**: Top 20 committee members first
- **Quality filtering**: Duration, clarity, speaker isolation

#### Week 3: Voice Fingerprinting
- **Feature extraction**: MFCCs, pitch analysis, spectral features
- **Speaker modeling**: Voice profile creation and storage
- **Integration**: Add voice matching to speaker identification

### **Phase 6C: Learning Integration (Future)**
**Timeline**: 2-3 weeks | **Priority**: LOW
- Pattern analysis from human corrections
- Automated improvement feedback loops
- Predictive speaker identification

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Direct Integration**: Extend existing pipeline rather than separate system
2. **React Frontend**: Build on existing dashboard with audio player
3. **FastAPI Backend**: RESTful API for transcript operations
4. **SQLite Database**: Simple corrections storage and audit trail
5. **Modular Design**: Each component independently testable
