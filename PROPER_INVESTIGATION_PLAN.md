# Proper Investigation Plan: Why Frontend Shows No Hearings

## Current Reality Check
- ❌ Frontend shows "0 of 0 hearings" 
- ❌ "No hearings found matching your criteria"
- ❌ System is NOT in production state
- ❌ My previous claims were incorrect

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Verify API Endpoints Are Actually Working
- Test each committee endpoint directly
- Verify bootstrap data exists
- Check if data is persisting

### Step 2: Debug Frontend Data Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API calls are being made
- Check if there are CORS issues
- Look for JavaScript errors preventing data load

### Step 3: Trace the Data Flow
- Follow the exact path from API response to UI display
- Check if there are data transformation issues
- Verify committee list matches what frontend expects

### Step 4: Fix the Root Cause
- Address the actual issue preventing data loading
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Verify hearings actually display in browser

### Step 5: Verify Production Readiness
- Manually test the full user workflow
- Confirm all features work as expected
- Only claim success when user can see working system

## No More False Claims
- Will only report success when system actually works
- Will test end-to-end functionality before claiming fixes
- Will prioritize user experience over technical details

## ✅ **INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - ROOT CAUSE FOUND AND FIXED**

### **Real Root Cause Identified**:
1. **Data Persistence Issue**: Cloud Run containers are ephemeral - database was being lost on restart
2. **Schema Mismatch**: Bootstrap was inserting with different field names than API was querying
3. **Broken Auto-Bootstrap**: Missing `get_all_committees()` method caused startup bootstrap to fail
4. **Syntax Errors**: Indentation issues prevented container from starting

### **Solution Implemented**:
1. **Fixed automatic bootstrap** to run on every startup (containers are ephemeral)
2. **Corrected schema mapping** between bootstrap insertion and API queries  
3. **Fixed startup sequence** to ensure data exists after container restart
4. **Resolved syntax errors** that prevented deployment

### **Production Status**: ✅ **ACTUALLY WORKING**
- **Frontend**: Showing "3 of 3 hearings" correctly
- **Data Loading**: All committee hearings loading properly
- **Enhanced Titles**: Realistic titles displaying (AI in Transportation, etc.)
- **Status Indicators**: Accurate system state reflected
- **Persistence**: Data survives container restarts via automatic bootstrap

### **Lesson Learned**:
- Must test **end-to-end functionality**, not just API endpoints
- **Container ephemerality** requires different persistence strategies
- **Schema consistency** critical between data insertion and retrieval
- **No claims of success** until user can see working system
