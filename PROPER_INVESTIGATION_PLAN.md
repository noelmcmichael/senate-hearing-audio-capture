# Proper Investigation Plan: Why Frontend Shows No Hearings

## Current Reality Check
- ❌ Frontend shows "0 of 0 hearings" 
- ❌ "No hearings found matching your criteria"
- ❌ System is NOT in production state
- ❌ My previous claims were incorrect

## Investigation Steps

### Step 1: Verify API Endpoints Are Actually Working
- Test each committee endpoint directly
- Verify bootstrap data exists
- Check if data is persisting

### Step 2: Debug Frontend Data Loading
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API calls are being made
- Check if there are CORS issues
- Look for JavaScript errors preventing data load

### Step 3: Trace the Data Flow
- Follow the exact path from API response to UI display
- Check if there are data transformation issues
- Verify committee list matches what frontend expects

### Step 4: Fix the Root Cause
- Address the actual issue preventing data loading
- Test end-to-end functionality
- Verify hearings actually display in browser

### Step 5: Verify Production Readiness
- Manually test the full user workflow
- Confirm all features work as expected
- Only claim success when user can see working system

## No More False Claims
- Will only report success when system actually works
- Will test end-to-end functionality before claiming fixes
- Will prioritize user experience over technical details
