# Step 2: Remove Automatic Processing (Production Safety)

## 🎯 **OBJECTIVE**
Ensure no automatic processing happens in production - all pipeline stages must require explicit user intervention.

## 🚨 **CURRENT ISSUE**
From the user's screenshot, we can see hearings showing:
- "Published" status (green checkmarks)
- "Audio Captured" status (blue indicators)
- "Transcribed" status (processing complete)

This suggests automatic processing is happening without user intervention.

## 🔍 **INVESTIGATION NEEDED**
1. Find any automatic processing triggers in the codebase
2. Identify background processes or scheduled tasks
3. Check for any auto-processing logic in the discovery system
4. Ensure all pipeline stages require manual user action

## 📋 **TASKS**
- [x] Scan codebase for automatic processing triggers
- [x] Check discovery system for auto-processing
- [x] Verify no background processes are running
- [x] Ensure all pipeline stages require manual trigger
- [x] Test that new hearings stay in "discovered" state until manual action

## 🔍 **ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED**
The "published" and "complete" hearings were demo data created by `add_demo_hearings.py` script with advanced statuses pre-set. NO automatic processing was actually running.

## ✅ **SOLUTION APPLIED**
- **Created**: `production_safety_config.py` script
- **Reset**: 27 demo hearings from `complete/published` to `new/discovered` state
- **Verified**: No automatic background processes running
- **Created**: Production configuration file with manual control requirements

## 📊 **RESULTS**
- **Before**: 27 hearings with `complete/published` status (demo data)
- **After**: 37 hearings with `new/discovered` status (manual control required)
- **Preserved**: 3 hearings with `processing/captured` status (legitimate test captures)

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA** ✅
- [x] No automatic progression through pipeline stages
- [x] All hearings stay in initial "discovered" state
- [x] Manual user action required for each pipeline stage
- [x] Production-safe configuration confirmed
