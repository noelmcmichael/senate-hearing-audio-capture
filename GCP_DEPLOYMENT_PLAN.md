# GCP Deployment Plan - Senate Hearing Audio Capture

## Overview
Deploying the Senate Hearing Audio Capture system to Google Cloud Platform using existing infrastructure code and CI/CD pipeline.

## Current Status
- âœ… Phase 1 Complete: CI/CD Infrastructure, Terraform, Docker
- âœ… Available Secrets: Google Client ID/Secret
- ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Deploy to GCP with professional-grade infrastructure

## Prerequisites Check
- [x] Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- [x] Docker containerization
- [x] CI/CD pipeline (GitHub Actions)
- [x] Google credentials available
- [ ] GCP project setup
- [ ] Service account credentials
- [ ] GitHub secrets configuration

## Step-by-Step Deployment Plan

### Phase 1: GCP Project Setup (15 minutes)
**Milestone**: GCP project configured with required services and permissions

#### Step 1.1: Verify GCP Project
- Check existing GCP projects
- Create new project if needed
- Enable billing account

#### Step 1.2: Enable Required APIs
- Cloud Run API
- Cloud SQL API
- Cloud Storage API
- Secret Manager API
- Cloud Monitoring API
- Cloud Build API

#### Step 1.3: Create Service Account
- Create deployment service account
- Assign required IAM roles
- Generate service account key
- Store in Memex secrets

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Deployment (20 minutes)
**Milestone**: All GCP resources provisioned and configured

#### Step 2.1: Configure Terraform
- Review terraform variables
- Set up terraform.tfvars
- Initialize terraform state

#### Step 2.2: Deploy Infrastructure
- Run terraform plan
- Deploy Cloud SQL database
- Deploy Redis instance
- Deploy Cloud Storage buckets
- Deploy Cloud Run service
- Configure Secret Manager

#### Step 2.3: Verify Infrastructure
- Test database connectivity
- Verify storage buckets
- Check Cloud Run deployment
- Validate monitoring setup

### Phase 3: Application Deployment (15 minutes)
**Milestone**: Application running in production on GCP

#### Step 3.1: Build and Push Container
- Build Docker image
- Push to Google Container Registry
- Tag with proper versions

#### Step 3.2: Deploy Application
- Deploy to Cloud Run
- Configure environment variables
- Set up health checks
- Configure auto-scaling

#### Step 3.3: Verify Application
- Test API endpoints
- Verify health checks
- Check logs and monitoring
- Test end-to-end functionality

### Phase 4: CI/CD Integration (10 minutes)
**Milestone**: Automated deployments working

#### Step 4.1: GitHub Secrets
- Add GCP_PROJECT_ID
- Add GCP_SA_KEY
- Configure repository secrets

#### Step 4.2: Test CI/CD Pipeline
- Trigger deployment via GitHub Actions
- Verify automated testing
- Check staging deployment
- Validate production deployment

#### Step 4.3: Monitor Pipeline
- Review deployment logs
- Check monitoring alerts
- Validate notifications

### Phase 5: Production Validation (10 minutes)
**Milestone**: System fully operational in production

#### Step 5.1: End-to-End Testing
- Test hearing discovery
- Test audio capture
- Test transcript processing
- Verify data storage

#### Step 5.2: Performance Testing
- Load testing
- Response time validation
- Resource utilization check
- Cost optimization

#### Step 5.3: Security Validation
- IAM permissions review
- Secret management check
- Network security validation
- Audit logging verification

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High Priority Risks
1. **Service Account Permissions**: Ensure proper IAM roles
2. **Database Connectivity**: Verify network configuration
3. **Storage Permissions**: Check bucket access rights
4. **Cost Management**: Monitor resource usage

### Mitigation Strategies
- Use least privilege IAM roles
- Test connectivity at each step
- Set up billing alerts
- Monitor resource usage

## Success Criteria
- [ ] All GCP services deployed and healthy
- [ ] Application accessible via public URL
- [ ] CI/CD pipeline functional
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting operational
- [ ] End-to-end workflow tested
- [ ] Production costs within budget

## Rollback Plan
- Keep local docker-compose environment
- Terraform destroy for quick cleanup
- GitHub Actions rollback capability
- Database backup strategy

## Next Steps After Deployment
1. Set up monitoring dashboards
2. Configure automated backups
3. Implement blue-green deployments
4. Scale testing with real hearings
5. Performance optimization

## Execution Notes
- Each phase has checkpoints for validation
- Commit code after each successful step
- Document any issues or deviations
- Confirm milestone completion before proceeding

**Total Estimated Time**: 70 minutes to production
**Success Rate**: High (leveraging existing infrastructure code)
