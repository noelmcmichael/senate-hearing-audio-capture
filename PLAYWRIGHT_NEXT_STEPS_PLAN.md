# Playwright Testing Framework - Next Steps Implementation Plan

## ðŸŽ¯ **OBJECTIVE**
Implement recommended next steps to enhance the Playwright testing framework and integrate it into the development workflow.

## ðŸ“‹ **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Workflow Integration**
**Goal**: Run tests automatically before code changes to prevent regressions
**Status**: ðŸ”„ In Progress

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Create pre-commit hooks for automatic test execution
- [ ] Set up GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Create test workflow documentation
- [ ] Add test running instructions to README

**Expected Outcome**: Tests run automatically on code changes, preventing broken deployments

### **Step 2: Add Test IDs**
**Goal**: Include data-testid attributes for precise element targeting
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**Tasks**:
- [x] Audit React components for missing data-testid attributes
- [x] Add strategic test IDs to critical UI elements
- [x] Update existing tests to use precise element targeting
- [x] Create test ID naming conventions

**Expected Outcome**: More reliable and maintainable test selectors

**Completed**:
- âœ… Added data-testid attributes to Dashboard.js (search, filters, sort, cards)
- âœ… Added data-testid attributes to HearingTranscript.js (buttons, table)
- âœ… Created enhanced test suite with data-testid selectors
- âœ… Generated test ID naming conventions (TEST_ID_CONVENTIONS.md)
- âœ… Created comprehensive audit script for future use

### **Step 3: Performance Monitoring**
**Goal**: Set up alerts for load time degradation
**Status**: âœ… Complete

**Tasks**:
- [x] Create performance baseline tracking
- [x] Set up automated performance alerts
- [x] Implement continuous performance monitoring
- [x] Create performance regression detection

**Expected Outcome**: Automatic detection of performance issues

**Completed**:
- âœ… Performance monitoring suite with Web Vitals tracking
- âœ… Performance baseline creation and regression detection
- âœ… Automated alert system with configurable thresholds
- âœ… Performance history tracking and trend analysis
- âœ… HTML reports with performance metrics and alerts
- âœ… Integrated into test workflow for continuous monitoring

### **Step 4: Expand Test Coverage**
**Goal**: Add authentication, mobile, and accessibility testing
**Status**: ðŸ“‹ Planned

**Tasks**:
- [ ] Add mobile responsive testing
- [ ] Add accessibility testing with axe-core
- [ ] Add cross-browser testing support
- [ ] Create advanced workflow testing

**Expected Outcome**: Comprehensive test coverage across all user scenarios

## ðŸš€ **GETTING STARTED**

### **Current Status**
- âœ… Playwright framework implemented
- âœ… Basic test suite operational
- âœ… Performance testing baseline established
- âœ… Error detection and reporting working

### **Next Action**
Starting with Step 1: Workflow Integration to integrate tests into development workflow.
