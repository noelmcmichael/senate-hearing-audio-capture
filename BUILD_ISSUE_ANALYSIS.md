# Build Issue Analysis & Fix Strategy

## üîç **ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS**

**What Went Wrong:**
1. **Heavy Dependencies**: The requirements.txt includes massive ML/AI packages:
   - `torch-2.7.1` (GPU version with CUDA)
   - `nvidia-*` packages (12 different CUDA packages)
   - `librosa`, `openai-whisper`, `scikit-learn`
   - Total install size: ~3-4GB of dependencies

2. **Build Timeout**: Docker build exceeded time limits during pip install
3. **Inefficient Build Strategy**: Installing everything from scratch every time

**The Problem**: We're trying to build a production container with development dependencies and heavy ML packages that take 10-15 minutes to install.

## üí° **SOLUTION STRATEGY**

### **Option 1: Lightweight Production Build (Recommended)**
- Create a production-only requirements.txt without heavy ML dependencies
- Use the deployed infrastructure's built-in services for processing
- Build completes in 2-3 minutes instead of 15 minutes

### **Option 2: Multi-Stage Build**
- Stage 1: Build heavy dependencies
- Stage 2: Copy only production artifacts
- Still takes time but more reliable

### **Option 3: Pre-built Base Image**
- Use an existing ML base image with dependencies pre-installed
- Faster but larger image size

**I recommend Option 1** - We can get the API deployed quickly and the infrastructure already handles the heavy processing.

## üöÄ **IMPLEMENTATION PLAN**

### **Step 1: Create Production Requirements (2 minutes)**
- Strip out development and ML dependencies
- Keep only API and database dependencies
- Test locally to ensure API still works

### **Step 2: Quick Build & Deploy (5 minutes)**
- Build with lightweight requirements
- Deploy to Cloud Run
- Test API endpoints

### **Step 3: Validate & Test (3 minutes)**
- Test all API endpoints
- Verify frontend works
- Check database connectivity

**Total Time: 10 minutes instead of 20+ minutes**

## üéØ **IMMEDIATE ACTIONS**

1. **Analyze current requirements.txt**
2. **Create production-only requirements**
3. **Build and deploy lightweight version**
4. **Test and validate**
