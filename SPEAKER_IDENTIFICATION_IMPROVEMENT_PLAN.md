# Speaker Identification Improvement Plan
## Phase 6: Human-in-the-Loop Speaker Correction & Voice Training

### ðŸŽ¯ **Strategic Objective**
Create a comprehensive speaker identification improvement system that enables human review, correction, and learning to achieve near-perfect accuracy in congressional hearing speaker identification through iterative human feedback and voice pattern recognition.

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Phase 6A: Human Review & Correction System**
*Timeline: 1-2 weeks*
*Priority: Critical*

### **Objective**
Build an intuitive interface for human reviewers to correct speaker identification errors with both granular and bulk correction capabilities.

### **Core Features**

#### **1. Review Interface**
- **Web-based transcript viewer** with speaker segments clearly highlighted
- **Audio playback integration** - click on segment to hear the audio
- **Speaker confidence scoring** display (high/medium/low confidence segments)
- **Unknown speaker highlighting** for segments that need identification
- **Committee context** showing expected speakers (members + witnesses)

#### **2. Correction Capabilities**
- **Individual Segment Correction**: Fix single speech blocks
- **Bulk Speaker Replacement**: "This is actually Senator Cruz throughout"
- **Speaker Merging**: Combine Speaker_1 and Speaker_3 as same person
- **Speaker Splitting**: Separate incorrectly merged speaker segments
- **Confidence Override**: Mark corrections as "high confidence" for training

#### **3. Correction Tracking**
- **Audit Trail**: Who made what changes when
- **Correction Reasons**: Why was this changed (wrong person, merge needed, etc.)
- **Quality Metrics**: Track accuracy improvements over time
- **Reviewer Performance**: Inter-reviewer agreement analysis

### **Technical Implementation**

#### **Database Schema**

## ðŸ“‹ **Phase 6B: Voice Pattern Recognition & Training Data**
*Timeline: 2-3 weeks*
*Priority: High*

### **Objective**
Collect and analyze voice samples from known senators to build voice fingerprints that complement text-based speaker identification.

### **Voice Data Collection Strategy**

#### **1. Primary Sources**
- **C-SPAN Archives**: Historical Senate floor speeches
- **Committee Hearing Archives**: Previous ISVP recordings
- **Official Senate Videos**: Senator statements and press conferences
- **YouTube Channel Content**: Official senator YouTube channels

#### **2. Voice Sample Requirements**
- **Minimum Duration**: 30+ seconds per sample for reliable fingerprinting
- **Quality Standards**: Clear audio, minimal background noise
- **Variety**: Different speaking contexts (formal hearing, floor speech, interview)
- **Recency**: Prioritize recent samples (voices change over time)

#### **3. Priority Committee Focus**
```
Commerce Committee (Priority 1):
- Chair: Maria Cantwell (D-WA) - 10+ samples target
- Ranking Member: Ted Cruz (R-TX) - 10+ samples target
- Top 5 most active members - 5+ samples each

Intelligence Committee (Priority 2):
- Chair: Tom Cotton (R-AR) - 10+ samples target
- Vice Chair: Marco Rubio (R-FL) - 10+ samples target
- Top 5 most active members - 5+ samples each

[Similar for Banking and Judiciary committees]
```

### **Voice Analysis Implementation**

#### **1. Voice Fingerprinting**
- **Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs)** for voice characteristics
- **Pitch analysis** and vocal range profiling
- **Speaking rate and rhythm** pattern analysis
- **Spectral features** for voice uniqueness

#### **2. Voice Recognition Pipeline**
```python
class VoiceRecognizer:
    def extract_voice_features(self, audio_segment):
        """Extract voice characteristics from audio"""
        
    def create_voice_fingerprint(self, speaker_id, audio_samples):
        """Build voice profile from multiple samples"""
        
    def match_voice_to_speaker(self, unknown_segment):
        """Identify speaker using voice characteristics"""
        
    def update_voice_profile(self, speaker_id, new_sample, confidence):
        """Improve profile with new confirmed samples"""
```

#### **3. Integration with Text-Based ID**
- **Weighted scoring**: Combine voice match + text pattern match
- **Confidence thresholds**: Only use voice ID when confidence > 80%
- **Fallback hierarchy**: Voice â†’ Text patterns â†’ Context clues â†’ Unknown

### **Deliverables**
- `src/voice/voice_recognizer.py` - Voice fingerprinting system
- `src/voice/sample_collector.py` - Automated sample collection from sources
- `src/voice/voice_trainer.py` - Profile building and training system
- `data/voice_profiles/` - Stored voice fingerprints for priority senators
- `voice_collection_pipeline.py` - Orchestration script

## ðŸ¤” **Questions for Review**

1. **Scope Prioritization**: Should we focus on Phase 6A first for immediate impact, or run 6A and 6B in parallel?

2. **Review Interface**: Web-based vs. desktop application for the review interface?

3. **Voice Collection**: Should we start with automated collection or manual curation for highest-quality samples?

4. **Integration Timing**: When should we integrate voice recognition with the existing pipeline?

5. **Quality Thresholds**: What accuracy targets should we set for each phase before moving to the next?

6. **Resource Allocation**: How many human reviewers should we plan for, and what's their expected throughput?
