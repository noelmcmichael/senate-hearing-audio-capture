# GCP Deployment Recovery Plan

## Current Issues Identified
1. **IAM Permissions**: Terraform service account lacks proper permissions for IAM policy management
2. **State Lock**: Terraform state is locked due to network connectivity issues
3. **Monitoring Alert**: Filter configuration needs refinement

## Recovery Steps

### Step 2: Fix IAM Permissions (CRITICAL)
- Grant terraform service account proper IAM roles
- Add resourcemanager.projectIamAdmin role
- Verify permissions

### Step 3: Continue Infrastructure Deployment
- Resume terraform apply with proper permissions
- Monitor deployment progress
- Verify all resources are created

### Step 4: Container Build and Push
- Build Docker image for the application
- Push to Google Container Registry
- Test container deployment

### Step 5: Application Deployment
- Deploy to Cloud Run
- Configure environment variables
- Test application endpoints

## Success Criteria
- All GCP resources provisioned successfully
- Application running on Cloud Run
- Health checks passing
- Monitoring and alerting operational
