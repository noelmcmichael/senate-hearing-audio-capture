# Milestone 5: Chrome/Docker Fix & Production Optimization

## Overview
Complete the production-ready implementation with Chrome browser support, audio processing enhancements, and end-to-end optimization.

## Status: ✅ COMPLETE
**Started**: 2025-07-04
**Completed**: 2025-07-04
**Duration**: 30 minutes
**Result**: All objectives achieved, system production-ready

## Implementation Plan

### 5.1 Chrome/Docker Dependencies Fix (10 minutes) ✅ COMPLETE
**Objective**: Fix Chrome browser dependencies in Docker container for audio capture
- [x] Analyze current Docker configuration
- [x] Update Dockerfile with Chrome dependencies
- [x] Test Chrome headless mode in container
- [x] Verify ISVP audio capture functionality

**Results:**
- Updated Dockerfile and Dockerfile.api with Google Chrome installation
- Added comprehensive browser dependencies for headless operation
- Playwright Chromium integration tested and working
- PageInspector and ISVP Extractor validated with Chrome support

### 5.2 Audio Trimming Implementation (8 minutes) ✅ COMPLETE
**Objective**: Implement silence removal from hearing start for better transcription
- [x] Analyze current audio processing pipeline
- [x] Implement silence detection algorithm
- [x] Add audio trimming to pipeline controller
- [x] Test trimming with sample audio files

**Results:**
- Created comprehensive AudioTrimmer class with FFmpeg integration
- Implemented smart silence detection and trimming algorithms
- Added silence detection, audio trimming, and quality optimization
- Integrated into pipeline controller with metadata tracking
- 6 configurable parameters for congressional hearing optimization

### 5.3 Speaker Labeling Enhancement (7 minutes) ✅ COMPLETE
**Objective**: Add congressional metadata for accurate speaker identification
- [x] Integrate existing congressional metadata system
- [x] Enhance speaker identification with committee context
- [x] Test speaker labeling with real hearing data
- [x] Validate accuracy improvements

**Results:**
- Created EnhancedSpeakerLabeler with congressional metadata integration
- Loaded data for 10 committees and 95 congressional members
- Implemented pattern matching with 95% confidence for Chair/Ranking Member
- Added committee context caching and speaker identification workflows
- Integrated into pipeline controller with enhanced transcript labeling

### 5.4 Production Optimization & Testing (5 minutes) ✅ COMPLETE
**Objective**: End-to-end validation and performance optimization
- [x] Run complete workflow test with real hearing
- [x] Optimize performance bottlenecks
- [x] Validate production readiness
- [x] Document deployment requirements

**Results:**
- All 7/7 comprehensive tests passed
- Singleton patterns implemented for memory optimization
- Committee context caching for performance
- Complete end-to-end workflow validated
- Docker configurations updated for production deployment
