# Service Recovery & Data Processing Plan

## Current Status Assessment
- Frontend appears to be down
- Need to verify all services are running
- Focus on real data processing pipeline
- Ensure hearings progress through all stages

## Step-by-Step Recovery Plan

### Phase 1: Service Status Check & Recovery
1. **Check All Running Services**
   - API Server (port 8001)
   - Frontend Dashboard (port 3000) 
   - Background Processor
   - Database connectivity

2. **Restart Any Down Services**
   - Start API server if needed
   - Start frontend dashboard if needed
   - Verify background processor is active

3. **Test Service Integration**
   - API endpoints responding
   - Frontend loading correctly
   - Database queries working

### Phase 2: Pipeline Status Assessment
4. **Check Current Hearing Pipeline Status**
   - Query database for current hearing states
   - Identify which hearings are at each stage
   - Verify processing workflow is active

5. **Assess Real vs Mock Data**
   - Identify hearings with real audio captures
   - Check quality of existing transcripts
   - Determine which need reprocessing

### Phase 3: Active Processing Push
6. **Process Hearings Through Pipeline**
   - Move hearings from 'discovered' to 'analyzed'
   - Initiate audio capture for 'queued' hearings
   - Run transcription for 'captured' hearings
   - Push more hearings to 'complete' status

7. **Monitor Processing Progress**
   - Real-time status updates
   - Quality check outputs
   - Error handling and recovery

### Phase 4: Quality Verification
8. **Test Full Workflow**
   - End-to-end hearing processing
   - Frontend display of real data
   - Speaker identification workflow
   - Export functionality

9. **Document Progress**
   - Update README.md with current status
   - Record processing metrics
   - Note any issues encountered

## Success Criteria
- All services running reliably
- Multiple hearings at 'complete' status with real data
- Frontend displaying accurate pipeline status
- Full workflow tested with meaningful content

## Risk Mitigation
- Backup database before major changes
- Test individual components before integration
- Monitor resource usage during processing
- Keep logs of all processing steps
